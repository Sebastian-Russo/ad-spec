      <h2>Adhesives Specialists, Inc.</h2>
      <div className="col">
        <p>Adhesives Specialists was created in 1983 as one of many adhesive companies. As the company has grown, the family has grown too. Direct family, as well as employees treated like family, alike. Over time and the last 30 plus years "AdSpec" has thrived and continued to push forward with it's ingenuity and progressive desire to jump on new technology before it's common place. Several years back, we were one of the first to switch from conveyor belt to underwater extrusion for hot melt. Less than a quarter of the adhesives companies still exist when AdSpec started in 1983. The bigger competitors buy up the small ones over the years for a client list, but forget to give the personal attention an individual customer needs. That's our niche. Our sales team answers and takes care of you when there is an emergency, and you need more glue.</p>
