      <h4>Advantages of low temp hot melt vs. standard 350째F hot melt</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Safety: The severity of a burn depends on the length of time that the area is held above the burn temperature. For example, 1 gramme of a traditional 350째, F hot melt requires 18 seconds to cool down below 180F, and will be constantly burning during those 18 seconds. Applied at 250째F, only 70째F above the burn temperature, Low Temperature hot Melts will significantly reduce the occurrence of severe burns.</li>
        <li>Reduced energy use: Measurements carried out in a production process showed that Low Temperature hot melts requires 33% less energy from the hot melt unit, all along the production cycle. This can produce considerable savings in a multi-line plant. The reduction in energy use will have a positive impact on the environment, and this is an important KPI for many leading food producers and Supermarkets.</li>
        <li>Improved Stability: Decrease in the thermal degradation of the adhesive</li>
      </ul>
