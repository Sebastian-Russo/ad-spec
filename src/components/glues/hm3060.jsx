      <h4>Advantages of low temp hot melt vs. standard 350°F hot melt</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Safety: The severity of a burn depends on the length of time that the area is held above the burn temperature. For example, 1 gramme of a traditional 350°F hot melt requires 18 seconds to cool down below 180°F, and will be constantly burning during those 18 seconds. Applied at 250°F, only 70°F above the burn temperature, Low Temperature hot Melts will significantly reduce the occurrence of severe burns.</li>
        <li>Reduced energy use: Measurements carried out in a production process showed that Low Temperature hot melts requires 33% less energy from the hot melt unit, all along the production cycle. This can produce considerable savings in a multi-line plant. The reduction in energy use will have a positive impact on the environment, and this is an important KPI for many leading food producers and Supermarkets.</li>

        <li>Improved Stability: Decrease in the thermal degradation of the adhesive</li>
        <li>Reduced Downtime: Reduce char generated in an adhesive application</li>
        <li>Reduced Maintenance Cost: 100°F difference reduces wear and tear on machinery</li>
        <li>Efficiency: Fast set speeds of Low temp have improve line speeds by 30%</li>
